Utility for regression testing of web pages using screenshots.

## Installation

Currently, requires [`GraphicsMagick`](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) and
[`chromedriver`](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver).

On MacOS X, both can be installed with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

```
brew install chromedriver graphicsmagick
```

Chromedriver also requires `Chrome` or `Chromium` to be installed.

After all dependencies have been satisfied, you can install package with `npm`:

```
npm install -g https://github.com/SevInf/shooter/archive/master.tar.gz
```
